# Style Rules

## Tone
- Reflective, grounded, and emotionally precise.
- Avoid melodrama; use restraint to heighten impact.

## Voice
- Lyrical but disciplined.
- Prefer concrete images over abstraction.
- Use short sentences to land key emotional beats.

## Philosophical Density
- Embed philosophy in action and consequence, not exposition.
- Keep a ratio of 1 reflective passage per 2-3 concrete scenes.
- When a concept appears, show its cost within the same chapter.

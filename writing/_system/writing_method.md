# Writing Method

This document describes the step-by-step method used to write novels in this workspace.

1) Intent and constraint
- Define the premise in one sentence.
- List non-negotiables (setting, POV, length, audience, taboo topics).

2) Question-driven exploration
- Generate 10-20 exploratory questions.
- Collect answers that reveal tension, stakes, and contradictions.

3) Theme selection
- Choose a primary theme and two supporting themes.
- Decide the moral pressure each theme applies to the protagonist.

4) World and logic
- Establish rules of the world and what breaks them.
- Define limits for magic/tech and the cost of violating limits.

5) Characters and forces
- Identify protagonist, antagonist, and mirror characters.
- Write each character's want, need, and fear.

6) Plot spine
- Build a beginning, escalation, and irreversible turning point.
- Decide the ending image and how it transforms the opening.

7) Outline
- Draft scene beats and the emotional arc per chapter.
- Flag unknowns instead of forcing answers early.

8) Drafting
- Write fast, focus on continuity and forward motion.
- Capture unresolved questions in margin notes.

9) Revision
- Re-read for theme clarity, causality, and pacing.
- Make one major structural pass before line edits.

10) Release readiness
- Confirm the story delivers the intended theme.
- Update revision_log.md with major decisions.

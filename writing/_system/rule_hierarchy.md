# Rule Hierarchy

Use this priority order when rules conflict. Higher priority overrides lower priority.

1) Chapter metadata
2) Novel README
3) Style profile
4) Global system rules

## Conflict Resolution
- Default to the highest-priority instruction and document any override in the chapter metadata notes.
- If two sources at the same level conflict, prefer the most recent update and add a short clarification note to the relevant file.

# Style Checklist

Use this checklist during revision or before a draft is marked final.

## Global Checks
- Chapter state in YAML frontmatter is accurate (draft | revised | final).
- All required metadata fields are present and filled.
- `writing/_system/revision_log.md` updated for major changes.

## Teen Fiction Checks
- Pacing stays brisk; scenes end on a turn or question.
- Sentences are mostly short to medium length with clear intent.
- Dialogue-forward: aim for dialogue to drive key beats.
- Abstraction is limited; emotions are shown through action and reaction.

## Literary Philosophy Checks
- Reflection deepens action rather than pauses it.
- Ambiguity is preserved; no forced moral conclusions.
- Metaphors are purposeful and tied to character experience.

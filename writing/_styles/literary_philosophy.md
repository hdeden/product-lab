# Literary Philosophy Style Profile

## Target Audience
- Adult readers who enjoy reflective, idea-driven fiction.

## Tone
- Contemplative, restrained, and precise.
- Emotion is felt through consequence and observation.

## Language Rules
- Lyrical but controlled; avoid ornament without purpose.
- Use vivid imagery to carry philosophical weight.
- Alternate longer reflective passages with concrete action.

## Themes
- Impermanence, agency, and moral ambiguity.
- The cost of meaning-making.
- Memory, loss, and responsibility.

## Structural Preferences
- Slower cadence with deliberate scene transitions.
- Recurring motifs that evolve across chapters.
- Philosophical beats embedded within action, not separate essays.

## Forbidden Patterns
- Didactic exposition that explains the theme outright.
- Abstract theorizing without a character cost.
- Sentimental closure that erases ambiguity.

## Codex Instructions
- Protect nuance; do not flatten ethical tension.
- Weave thematic reflection into scene consequence.
- Flag any passage that becomes lecture-like or over-explained.

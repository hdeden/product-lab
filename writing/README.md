# Writing

This folder holds the writing pipeline that sits alongside the rest of the workspace. It keeps creative work separated from product work while still sharing the same tooling, notes, and review habits used elsewhere in the repo.

## Phase Flow

idea -> exploration -> theme -> outline -> draft -> revision

Each phase has its own folder and template to keep scope small and decisions traceable.

## Tools: Codex and Gemini

- Codex: structured help for planning, outlining, tracking decisions, and turning notes into drafts. Used for clarity, consistency, and speeding up iteration.
- Gemini: divergent ideation, alternative takes, and pressure-testing themes. Used to broaden options before converging.

No story text is stored here until a phase explicitly calls for it in its folder.

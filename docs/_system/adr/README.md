# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Purpose
Record important architectural decisions in a consistent, searchable format.

## Format
Create one file per decision using this structure:

- Title
- Status (proposed, accepted, superseded)
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives
- Consequences

## Naming
Use `YYYYMMDD-short-title.md` for new ADRs.

## Rules
- Keep each ADR focused on a single decision.
- Link related ADRs when decisions evolve.
- Update status when a decision changes.

# Product Lab

## Structure
- `docs/_system/` holds shared system docs (research method, decision log, glossary, ADR guidance).
- `docs/_templates/` contains reusable templates for research and delivery artifacts.
- `projects/<product>/` is the workspace for each product, with docs, app, and backend folders.

## Research to Delivery Flow
1) Explore the problem space.
2) Plan and run research.
3) Synthesize findings.
4) Define requirements and business analysis design.
5) Produce a technical spec.
6) Plan implementation and testing.
7) Deliver in the product workspace.

## Codex and Gemini Usage
- Codex: create structure, generate drafts, refactor docs, and maintain consistency.
- Gemini: cross-check findings, propose alternatives, and validate assumptions.

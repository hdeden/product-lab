## Synthesis

### Problem
- UMKM cafe and security companies still manage HR manually, causing payroll errors, slow admin cycles, and weak visibility of attendance and leave.

### Opportunity
- Mobile-first HRIS tailored for operational staff can reduce admin time, improve payroll accuracy, and increase transparency for employees.

### Target Users
- HR admins and business owners (web dashboard).
- Operational staff (mobile attendance, leave, payslip access).
- Managers/supervisors (approval and shift oversight).

### MVP Scope
- Attendance with GPS and optional selfie verification.
- Leave/permit requests with approval flow.
- Payroll basics (attendance/leave inputs, configurable components, digital payslips).
- Employee self-service (payslips, attendance history, leave balance).
- Web admin dashboard for employee data, policies, and reporting.

### Phase 2 Adds
- Payroll statutory calculations (PPh21, BPJS) and advanced payroll rules.

### Differentiation
- Shift scheduling and multi-location support suited for cafe and security operations.
- Simple UI in Bahasa Indonesia with minimal steps for daily actions.

### Key Assumptions
- Target users have smartphones and are comfortable with basic mobile apps.
- Clients value quick onboarding (less than 1 week) and local support.
- Pricing must fit UMKM budgets (per-employee subscription).

### Risks
- Adoption friction if UI is too complex.
- Regulatory changes in payroll/tax rules.
- Scaling performance at peak attendance times.
